Hello!

I'm *Laura Ketola*. Often nindwen/Persikka on the internet. At the moment, I'm a third year CS student at the University of Tampere, Finland.

In practise I mostly do Web Dev nowadays, but my love is always in simplistic/UNIX/CLI -stuff. VR is cool. Statically typed languages are cool. Writing in plain text is cool.

Outside tech, I am a tolkien-geek, trying to enjoy the nature as much as the Finnish winter allows and sometimes failing pretending to be a normal person. Sauron is cool. My boyfriend is cool. Autumn is cool.

This is my front page / contact info.
